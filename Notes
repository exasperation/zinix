Architectural notes

The initial target machine is the N8VEM SBC V2 with 512 KB of SRAM, some
form of disk storage, a UART and a regular interrupt.

The emulator has a 16550 UART at the SBC V2 IO ports, using the Altair
HDSK which works on 128 byte sectors and a regular interrupt 10 times a
second.

The first page of memory 0000 - 00ff is reserved for the interrupt, reset
and CP/M emulator code.

ff00 - ffff is reserved for the HBIOS.

The top 32 KB of memory from 8000 - ff00 is reserved for the OS.

Applications have from 0100 - 7fff for their use.

Booting uses RomWBW BIOS, but could be readily adapted to boot from CP/M.
