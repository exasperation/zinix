N8VEM Memory Page Configuration Latched (MPCL) - Classic (Jumpers K10 1-2 and K11 1-2)

The original N8VM SBC and the N8VEM SBC V2 (with jumpers K10 1-2 and K11 1-2) provides a 32K 
window into the RAM chip that is mapped into the lower 32K of the Z80's address space.  This 
allows access to all the locations the memory chip.  It has been used as a way to build a 
memory disk by selectively copying blocks of data in and out of the windows.  It does mean 
that lower 32K not static and that must be considered when
thinking about how to handle interrupts.

Additionally, there is an additional latch (MPCL_ROM 7CH) that allows a similar windowing of 
the ROM into the lower 32K.

Both latches can be set independently of each other, but only the ROM or the RAM can be winded 
at any moment.  This is handled by bit 7 on the MPCL_ROM latch.   If it is set to 1, than RAM 
is selected for the window.  If it is set to 0, the ROM window is selected.
On reset, the latches default to a setting of all 0s.  This means that the lower 32K of the 
ROM is selected and that the lower 32K of the ram chip is selected in the ram latch, but not 
enabled since the bit 7 of the MPCL_ROM

The latches can NOT be read.  Read access to the two ports will likely result in undesirable 
results.

Additionally, there is hardware that forces all Z80 ram access in 0800H-FFFFH to be forced 
into the upper 32K of the memory chip.  This allows code to execute in the upper 32K without 
the fear that the latch will map memory out from under it.  However, it is possible to have 
the upper 32K of the memory chip to be mapped into the lower window at the same time you are 
executing out of the upper 32k.  Beware!!!

Any routine that manipulate the MPCL_RAM and MPCL_ROM latches should live in the upper 32K of 
the Z80 address space when in classic mode

A 512KB memory chip gives us sixteen (16) 32K windows that can be mapped.  The upper 32K of 
15th bank has the upper 32K as common.

N8VEM Memory Page Configuration Latched (MPCL) - Alternate  (Jumpers K11 2-3 and K10 2-3)



The N8VEM SCB V2 has jumpers that provides a different MPCL operation.  With jumpers (K11 2-3 
and K10 2-3) two changes take place.
First, hardware now maps Z80 bus access for the upper 16K of address space into the high 16K 
of the memory chip (as opposed to 32K).
Second, the RAM windowing now occurs in 64K chunks. (bit 0 of the RAM_MPCL is no longer valid)

Because the upper 16K of the 64K windows are remapped, the 64K chunks act like selectable 48K 
banks with a 16K common bank that is always accessible to the Z80. This is well suited for use 
with CP/M 3 and MP/M 2 to be run in "banked" mode with a 48K/16K split for banked/common 
memory.


The N8VEM SBC V2 MPCL alternate jumper settings results in almost 1/4 of the memory chip as 
not accessible (NA), but the 48K/16K allows MP/M and CP/M 3 to be configured for "banked mode" 
operations with large TPAs.  The classic jumper settings allows access to all the memory. but 
operates as a 32K/32K banked/common.

The ROM windowing works the same as described above - 32K chunks of the ROM are mapped into 
the lower 32K of the Z80s address space by setting the MPCL_ROM latch.


A 512KB memory chip gives us eight (8) 64K windows that can be mapped.  The upper 16K of the 
first 7 banks are inaccessible and the 8th bank has the upper 16K as common.

MPCL Usage

The standard N8VEM bootrom uses extra memory as a ram disk.  64K is allocated for the z80 to 
run programs and the rest is used as a ram disk.  

RAM disk operation is done by treating 128 byte chunks of memory as disk sectors.  A disk 
parameter block is built with parameters that size it to be the extra ram.

A routine in the bios translates sector and track numbers into a 32K window and offset in RAM.
The MPCL_RAM latches are set to bring that memory window into the lower 32K window.
It copies the data in/out of the lower 32K memory into a sector buffer that is in the "common" 
area in the upper 32K window.
The MPCL_RAM latch are set back to its original value so that the lower 32K is back to the 
original window that has code.
The BIOS then copies the sector the the desired "DMA" address.
In MPCL Classic mode, all copy and mapping routines must execute from the upper 32K window of 
RAM.


Max Scene took the next step to reserve a bit more of the ram for CP/M 3.0 and implemented a 
32K/32K banked/common configuration.  This works well for CP/M 3.0 and should allow MP/M 2.0 
to run.  The rest of the ram is still used as a ram disk. New bootroms were created to reflect 
the changes in the ram disk.

MP/M, which allows multiple programs to be concurrently running, is best suited to a machine 
where the banked memory size is larger. This allows more space for bigger programs to be run.  
A 48K/16K model, with more than two banks for TPAs works well.


The N8VEM SBC V2 MPCL Alternate mode provides a 48K/16K model with up to 8 banks. All eight 
banks can be used by the OS or as in the classic mode, a few banks could be used by the OS and 
the rest can be used as a RAM disk. RAM disk mapping becomes more complicated and the 
available ram disk space is smaller due to the inaccessible areas of the RAM chip.

In MPCL Alternate mode, manipulation of the MPCL_RAM and MPCL_ROM latches must execute from 
the upper 16K of the Z80 address space (the common bank).  The stack should also live in the 
common space


Note: The upper 16K inaccessibility was an understood tradeoff. Unfortunately, extra gates 
were not available to preserve the function of bit 0 of the MPCL_RAM.  This would have 
maintained a 32K window for mapping the ram chip yet still allow a 48K/16K split. SBC V3??

===============================================================================================

MPCL Impacts on Booting

ROM access is the same in both Classic and Alternate MPCL modes.  The only change for ROM 
access is that that access to the MPCL_ROM and MPCL_RAM I/O ports should only be done from the 
upper 16K of the z80 address space (C000H - FFFFH).  This shouldn't impact CP/M or MP/M since 
the BIOS should live in upper memory.
